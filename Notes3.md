# Tree pointing Sub-trees

- Create a new git repository name *Internals*  (1)

- Adding some sub folders (2)

- Created A1 file under folder/A1 directory and adding it under staging area. (3)

- After committing 4 more git objects are created. (Number of Tree == Number of nested directories ) (4,5)

- Similarly created an A2.txt file under directory folder2/A2/ and committed the changes (So total 5 more objects have been added) (6,7)

- Now we have updated A1.txt and committed it (8) and so total we have 15 objects (9) (smart layer compression one object into one folder)

- Now we have updated A2.txt file under directory folder2/A2/ and committed the changes ( So total objects 20) (10)

- Now creating a new file under folder1/B1 with B1.txt with Updating both A2.txt and A1.txt file in one commit. (11,12)

- Now making A1.txt file changes as A1 A1 (previous version) and committing changes (13)

- Tracking and pointing is done based on file content and trees are basically  sub-directories
